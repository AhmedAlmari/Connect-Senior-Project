####Arabic Sign Language Interpreter - Senior Project

We are thrilled to announce that our senior project has been nominated as one of the best AI projects in the NGIS 2023 competition. Our project is a real-time Arabic sign language interpreter.

Given the lack of available data for Arabic sign language, we undertook the challenge of creating our own dataset. This effort was instrumental in the development and success of our interpreter.
